  "it isnâ€™t enough to write about Doctors at length To save human lives only they have the strength,Seeing so much suffering is in itself a huge test Fighting against diseases without thinking of rest, The disease may be contagious, but they are not afraid They serve the patient round the clock, it has to be said, During Covid they put their lives in danger, you may find it odd On earth, only these Supermen can be compared to God,It seems they have an abundance of compassion in their heart."

 <p class="para">&ensp; Doctors With over more than 212 million cases worldwide. There were more than 4 million deaths and more than 189 million Covid-19 patients were recovered.
  Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.

  <p class="para">&ensp;At least 17,000 health workers have died worldwide from COVID-19 over the last year, Amnesty International has said, while also calling for a rapid vaccine release to protect millions of front-line healthcare workers.<br></p>
  <p class="para">  &ensp;The human rights group called on governments to include all front-line workers in their vaccine distribution plans as many poorer countries are expected to receive their first batches in the coming weeks and months.<br></p>
  <p class="para">&ensp;Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.<br> </p>
